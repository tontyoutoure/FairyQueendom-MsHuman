And what replaced humans on Earth is a kind of unidentified creatures that look like fairy only appear in fairy tales. The average height of the fairy is only 10 centimeters, but the three-headed fairies have a high degree of intelligence, and are very fond of eating candy and desserts. After graduating as the last class of the graduates, Ms. Human returned to her hometown of Camphorwood Villiage to take over her grandfather's work and became an important international civil servant "mediator" responsible for mediating between fairies and humans. However, because fairies rarely come into contact with humans, she has little work to do. One day, she drifted with the fairies to a small island, and since then discovered the excellence of these magical creatures as nationals.</Text>
